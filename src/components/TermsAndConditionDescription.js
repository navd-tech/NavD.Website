              <p>
                “Personal information” is data or information that can be used
                to identify or contact an individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be asked to provide your personal information any time
                you are in contact with NavD. We may share this information with
                our affiliates and they may use it consistently with this
                Privacy Notice. You are not required to provide the personal
                information that we request, but, if you choose not to do so, we
                may not be able to provide you with our Products or respond to

              <h4>1.1. What Personal Information We Collect</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When you request information, download or access software, or
                  participate in an online forum, we may collect a variety of
                  information, including your name, mailing address, phone

                  If you invite others to participate in NavD Products or
                  forums, NavD may collect the information you provide about
                  those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and
                  phone number.

              </ul>
              <p />
              <h4>1.2. How We Use Your Personal Information</h4>
              <p>
                The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted
                on NavD&apos;s latest product announcements, software updates,
                and upcoming events. If you don&apos;t want to be on our mailing
                list, you can opt out any time by clicking on the applicable
                unsubscribe buttons in each marketing email or contacting us
                directly with your request (see Section 12, below).
              </p>
              <p>
                We may use your personal information to send important notices,
                such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms,
                conditions, and policies, and to provide support and maintenance
                for our Products. Because this information is important to your
                interaction with NavD, you may not opt out of receiving these
                communications.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use personal information to help us create, develop, operate,
                deliver, and improve our products, services, and content, and
                for anti-fraud purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also use personal information for internal purposes such
                as auditing, data analysis, and customer communications.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we combine non-personal information with personal
                information, the combined information will be treated as
                personal information for as long as it includes personal
                information.
              </p>
              <h4>1.3. Collection and Use of Additional Information</h4>
              <p>
                We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit
                direct association with any specific individual. We may collect,
                use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any
                purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal
                information that we may collect and how we may use it:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  We may collect information such as language, zip code, area
                  code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and
                  the time zone where a NavD Product is used so that we can
                  better understand customer behavior and improve our products
                  and services.

                  parts of the Site, Products, and services are of most
                  interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal

                  We may collect and store details of how you use our Products,

                NavD&apos;s Site, online services, Products, email messages, and
                advertisements may use &quot;cookies&quot; and other
                technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These
                technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us
                which parts of the Sites people have visited, and facilitate and
                measure the delivery of our Products. We treat information
                collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal
                information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar
                identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we
                also treat these identifiers as personal information.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also gather some information automatically and store it in
                log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser
                type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring
                and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time
                stamp, clickstream data, state change information, and metadata.
                We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to
                administer the services and Products, to learn about user
                behavior on the site, to improve our Product and services, and
                to gather demographic information about our user base.
              </p>
              <p>
                NavD also uses cookies and other technologies to remember
                personal information when you use the Site or our online
                Products. Knowing your country and language helps us provide a
                customized and more useful access to our Products. If you want
                to disable cookies, most browsers will permit you to do so.
                Please note that certain features of the NavD website will not
                be available once cookies are disabled.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some of our email messages, we may use a “click-through URL”
                linked to content on the NavD website. When users click one of
                these URLs, they may pass through a separate web server before
                arriving at the destination page on the Site. We track this
                click-through data to help us determine interest in particular
                topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer
                communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
                should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

              <p>
                Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format
                customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been
                opened. We may use this information to streamline and focus
                messages sent to customers and others.

                NavD&apos;s Site, online services, Products, email messages, and

              <h4>3.2. Strategic Partners</h4>
              <p>
                NavD may make certain personal information available to
                strategic partners that work with NavD to provide products and
                services, or that help NavD market to customers. Personal
                information will only be shared by NavD to provide or improve
                our Products and services subject to this Privacy Notice, and it
                will not be shared with third parties for their marketing
                purposes.
              </p>
              <h4>3.3. Per Your Request</h4>
              <p>
                In certain cases, you may request that we provide some of your
                personal information to a third party. For example, if you ask
                us to forward a white paper to a third party, then we will
                provide some personal information to the third party so he or
                she will know why we are communicating.
              </p>
              <h4>3.4. Others</h4>
              <p>
                It may be necessary — by law, legal process, litigation, or
                requests from public and governmental authorities within or
                outside your country of residence — for NavD to disclose your
                personal information. We may also disclose information about you
                if we determine that for purposes of national security, law
                enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is
                necessary or appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also disclose information about you if we determine that
                disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and
                conditions or protect our operations or users. In the event of a
                reorganization, merger, or sale, we may transfer any personal
                information we collect to the relevant third parties.

                NavD protects your personal information during transit to the

                When your personal data is stored by NavD, we use computer
                systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical
                security measures. Except for logs with IP addresses, your
                personal information is stored in encrypted form including when
                we utilize third party storage.

              <p>
                NavD takes reasonable physical, electronic and administrative
                measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized
                access, use, damage, or destruction. No method of transmitting
                information over the Internet or storing information is

                When you use some NavD Products, services, or applications or

                the personal information and content you choose to share is
                visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by
                them. You are responsible for the personal information you
                choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if
                you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that

              <p>
                NavD does not respond to Do Not Track signals. In connection
                with marketing activities, NavD may track its customers over
                time and across third party websites to provide targeted
                advertising. In addition, you should understand that some
                third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when
                they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they
                present to you.
